ðŸš€ Celebrating Success at the Vex Go Moroccan Championship! ðŸš€

I am absolutely thrilled to share my experience from the second edition of the Vex Go Moroccan Championship, where I had the honor of contributing to its success! Held at the prestigious Salle Omnisports Ibn Yassine in Rabat on May 25th, it was an unforgettable day filled with innovation and excitement.

As I managed chrono time and diligently recorded teams' points, I was continually inspired by the passion and dedication displayed by the young participants. Their commitment to robotics and STEM education was truly commendable.

Enjoy these snapshots capturing the day's energy and enthusiasm! A heartfelt thank you to all who made this event possible. Your dedication is shaping the future of STEM education in Morocco! ðŸŒŸ

Let's continue to champion innovation, creativity, and learning in the world of robotics! ðŸ¤–âœ¨
