# ðŸš€ Exciting Update from NRC 6th Edition Hackathon! ðŸ¤–

## I'm thrilled to share that I recently represented the Robotics Club FSR at the NRC 6th Edition, a national robotics competition hosted by Emines Technology Club at UM6P - Mohammed VI Polytechnic University. This 24-hour hackathon took place on March 29-31, 2024.

## I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to my amazing team members, Youssef Baissi, Aymen Bouaaricha, and Nouh Ait Tachfi, for their dedication and collaboration throughout the competition.

## Special thanks to the organizers from Emines Technology Club for hosting such a well-organized and inspiring event! The NRC 6th Edition provided an incredible platform to showcase our robotics skills, including design ingenuity, programming, and mechanics. We learned valuable lessons and built meaningful connections with participants from across the region.

## Looking forward to leveraging this experience as we continue to innovate and excel in the field of robotics! ðŸŒŸðŸ’¡
