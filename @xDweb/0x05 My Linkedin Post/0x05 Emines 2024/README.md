I'm delighted to share that I secured the 3rd place in the 7th edition of the Moroccan Robotics Challenge, held on May 25th and 26th at Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Rabat. It was an exhilarating experience competing alongside some of the brightest minds in the field of robotics.

A huge thank you to the clubminesmakers for organizing such a fantastic event. Your dedication to fostering innovation and collaboration is truly commendable.

Though the journey was challenging, the lessons learned and the connections made are invaluable. Here's to continuous growth, learning, and future successes in the world of robotics! 🚀🏅
