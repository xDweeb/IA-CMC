ðŸ”” **Exciting News!** ðŸ””

I'm delighted to share that I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the **Medical Innova Startup Hackathon** on April 29th and 30th, held in conjunction with the Morocco Medical Expo under the esteemed patronage of His Majesty King Mohammed VI.

As the lead responsible for three teams representing **Club Robotique FSR**, I had the pleasure of guiding our talented participants through this innovative event. It was a truly enriching experience to also be a participant myself, gaining valuable insights and skills from the formation sessions on:

- **Design Thinking**
- **Entrepreneurial Coaching**
- **Expert Scientific Methodology**

A heartfelt thank you to the organizers, @INNOVATECH ENSAM-R Club, and **Club Robotique FSR** for making this opportunity possible. Your hard work and dedication have made a significant impact on all of us.

Congratulations to all the teams for their remarkable efforts and achievements! Let's continue to push the boundaries of innovation and technology in healthcare.
